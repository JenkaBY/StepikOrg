    Pie company is looking for talanted baker and you are invited to implement one.
    The baker's duty is to get orders for bakery and it's varieties and produce it.
     Class definition and method's backbone follows:
         class Paper {}
        class Bakery {}
        class Cake extends Bakery {}
        class ReflexiveBaker {
            // Create bakery of the provided class.
           * @param order class of bakery to create
           * @return bakery object
          public Object bake(Class order) {
            // Add implementation here
          }
        }
        The task is to redesign method signature types if needed and to add implementation. The bake method should conform to the following:
            Create objects of class Bakery or any subclass of it according to class argument
            Flag compile-time error if order argument is not Bakery or any subclass of it (e.g. if it is Paper or Object)
        ï»¿It's guaranteed that all subclasses of Bakery will have public parameterless constructor.
