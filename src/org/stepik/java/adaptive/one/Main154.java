        In the Roman numbering system, the following symbols are used to represent numbers (on the right are the numbers,
        which correspond to these symbols in the decimal system):
            I = 1
            V = 5
            X = 10
            L = 50
            C = 100
            D = 500
            M = 1000
        We use an option in which the numbers 4, 9, 40, 90, 400 and 900 are represented by a subtraction of a smaller number
        from a larger one: IV, IX, XL, XC, CD and CM, respectively.
        Write a program that converts the number from Roman system into the decimal one.
        Input format:
            The string, containing the number, encoded into the Roman numbering system. It is guaranteed that this number is less than 4000.
        Output format:
            The string, containing the number in the decimal numbering system, which corresponds to the input.
        Sample Input 1:
            MCMLXXXIV
        Sample Output 1:
            1984
        Sample Input 2:
            IX
        Sample Output 2:
            9
        Sample Input 3:
            III
        Sample Output 3:
            3
